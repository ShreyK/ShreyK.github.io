        Hey Babe,

        So Valentine's is tomorrow and I knooww you wanna do this whole thing with the girls there but just for the
        sake of it I still wanted to do this.
        I know you love V-Day and all (remember when I thought it was related to D-day :P) and I'm sorry I couldnt
        be there with you for our first one :( 
        But you will be here in under a month so I was kinda hoping that we could have our own little 
        Valentine's Day for when you are back :) 

        So .... *That Awkward Moment* ...
        
        Will ..
        
        You ...
        
        Be .. My ..
        
        Girl- *cough* ahem ahem *cough* 
        
        <span>Valentine ?</span> 
        
        
        Your thingy, 
        Shrey â™¥
